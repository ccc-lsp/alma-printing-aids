# Excel macro that allows a user to print a well formatted version of the “print slip report” with a single button in Excel.

Like Collin, we normally use the "Print Slips" option. That said, like you we also found the “print slip report” spreadsheet tedious to format for printing.

Steps:
1.  Create a personal macro workbook. See [1].
2.  Update the workbook with the code attached in the text file.
3.  Add Macro button to MS Excel’s quick access toolbar.
4.  Profit!?!
 
It is not something I would want to deploy and maintain on numerous workstations, but it works well on a single workstation where the “print slip report” is normally printed.
